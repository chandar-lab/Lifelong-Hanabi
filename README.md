# Other-Play & Simplified Action Decoder in Hanabi

## Important Update, Sep-2020

The repo has been updated to include Other-Play, auxiliary task, as well as improved
training infrastructure. The build process has also been significantly simplfied. It
is no longer necessary to build pytorch from source (thanks to changes in pytorch1.5)
and the code now works with newer version of pytorch and cuda. 
It also avoids the hanging problem that may appear in
previous version of the codebase on certain hardware configuration.

## Introduction

This repo contains code and models for
["Other-Play" for Zero-Shot Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02979)
and [Simplified Action Decoder for Deep Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02288).

## Compile
We have been using `pytorch-1.5.1`, `cuda-10.1`, and `cudnn-v7.6.5` in our development environment.
Other settings may also work but we have not tested it extensively under different configurations.
We also use `conda/miniconda` to manage environments.
```bash
# create new conda env
conda create -n hanabi python=3.7
conda activate hanabi

# install pytorch
pip install torch==1.5.1+cu101 torchvision==0.6.1+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# install other dependencies
pip install numpy
pip install psutil

# if the current cmake version is < 3.15
conda install -c conda-forge cmake
```

### Clone & Build this repo
For convenience, add the following lines to your `.bashrc`,
after the line of `conda activate xxx`.

```bash
# set path
CONDA_PREFIX=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
export CPATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/include:${CPATH}
export LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib:${LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# avoid tensor operation using all cpu cores
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
```

Clone & build.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/facebookresearch/hanabi.git

cd hanabi
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j10
```

## Run

`hanabi/pyhanabi/tools` contains some example scripts to launch training
runs. `dev.sh` is a fast lauching script for debugging. It needs 2 gpus to run,
1 for training and 1 for simulation. Other scripts are examples for a more formal
training run, they require 3 gpus, 1 for training and 2 for simulation.

The important flags are:

`--sad 1` to enable "Simplified Action Decoder";

`--pred_weight 0.25` to enable auxiliary task and multiply aux loss with 0.25;

`--shuffle_color 1` to enable other-play.

```bash
cd pyhanabi
sh tools/dev.sh
```

## Trained Models

Run the following command to download the trained models used to
produce tables in the paper.
```bash
cd model
sh download.sh
```
To evaluate a model, simply run
```bash
cd pyhanabi
python tools/eval_model.py --weight ../models/sad_2p_10.pthw --num_player 2
```

## Related Repos

The results on Hanabi can be further improved by running search on top
of our agents. Please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02318) and
[code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Hanabi_SPARTA) for details.

We also open-sourced a single agent implementation of R2D2 tested on Atari
[here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/rela).
